In case you didn’t notice, I found almost nothing of any value in The Lost City of Z. It’s an adventure without any sense of adventure, a tale of obsession from a character who never appears obsessed, and an epic that’s more of an epic failure. I know for a fact from conversations leaving the theater that others don’t feel the same way, but I found this a plodding, profoundly empty trudge into a barren wilderness.
